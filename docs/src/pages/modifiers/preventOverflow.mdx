# Prevent Overflow

The preventOverflow modifier can move the popper
when the `detectOverflow` modifier reported it's
overflowing in any direction.

By default, only the main axis is checked, that means if
a popper with `bottom` placement is overflowing on the right
of its boundary element, it will be moved on the left so that
it stays within its boundaries.  
This behavior can be disabled by setting `options.mainAxis` to `false`.

```js
new Popper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        mainAxis: false, // true by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Optionally, the alternative axis check can be enabled, by setting
`options.altAxis` to `true`.  
This will make the modifier check also the other axis, but keep
in mind that this may lead the popper to overlap its reference element.

```js
new Popper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        altAxis: true, // false by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
