# Prevent Overflow

The preventOverflow modifier can move the popper when the `detectOverflow`
modifier reported it's overflowing in any direction.

## Options

```js
type Options = {
  mainAxis: boolean, // = true
  altAxis: boolean, // = false
  tether: Tether, // = 'center'
  padding: Padding, // = 0
};
```

### Options#mainAxis

By default, only the main axis is checked, that means if a popper with `bottom`
placement is overflowing on the right of its boundary element, it will be moved
on the left so that it stays within its boundaries. This behavior can be
disabled by setting `options.mainAxis` to `false`.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        mainAxis: false, // true by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Options#altAxis

Optionally, the alternative axis check can be enabled, by setting
`options.altAxis` to `true`. This will make the modifier check also the other
axis, but keep in mind that this may lead the popper to overlap its reference
element.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        altAxis: true, // false by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Options#tether

While trying to keep the popper element within its boundaries is usually a
welcome behavior, we don't usually want to reach the point where the reference
and popper elements are not touching eachother at all, since that would make it
difficult for the user to understand where a popper originated from.

The default behavior to avoid this situation, is to stop to try to keep the
popper within its defined boundaries once the center of the popper reaches the
edge of its reference element. This tether behavior is called `center`.

Alternatively, this option can accept `edges`, which will work similarly to
`center`, but will kick in only when the popper edge reaches the reference edge.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        tether: 'edges',
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

The `surfaces` behavior, instead, will kick in once the opposite edges are
level.

To conclude, the tether option can be disabled all together by setting it to
`false`, so that the popper will detach from its reference element if required
to keep it within its defined boundaries.

### Options#padding

You can apply some additional padding to the boundaries defined by the
`detectOverflow` modifier by setting this option to a number, to apply the
padding evenly to all the four sides, or to an object containing the `top`,
`left`, `bottom`, `right` properties, with a padding number for each side.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        padding: { top: 20, right: 10 },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
