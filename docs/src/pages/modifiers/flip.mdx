# Flip

The flip modifier can change the `placement` of a popper when the
`detectOverflow` modifier reported it's overflowing on the direction of the
currently given placement.

If the popper has placement set to `bottom`, but there isn't space to position
the popper in that direction, by default, it will change the popper placement to
`top`. As soon enough space is detected, the placement will be reverted to the
originally defined one.

You can also define a custom "flip" behavior, by providing a list of placements
to try. Doing so, when no space is available on the defined placement, the
modifier will test the ones provided in the list, and use the first useful one.

```js
new Popper(reference, popper, {
  placement: 'left',
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      options: {
        behavior: ['top', 'right'],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

In the above example, the popper will be placed on left if there's enough space,
if not, it will try the top placement, and if even on the top placement there's
not enough space, it will try to use the right placement. Note that if none of
the placements is suitable, the original left placement will be used.
