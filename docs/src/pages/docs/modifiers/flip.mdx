# Flip

The `flip` modifier can change the `placement` of a popper when it's scheduled
to overflow a given boundary.

<x-ad />

## Demo

The placement is set to `bottom`, but if that placement does not fit, the
opposite `top` placement will be used.

<FlipDemo />

## Phase

`main`

## Options

```flow
type Options = {
  fallbackPlacements: Array<Placement>, // [oppositePlacement]
  padding: Padding, // 0,
  boundary: Boundary, // "clippingParents"
  rootBoundary: RootBoundary, // "viewport"
  flipVariations: boolean, // true
};

// Below are the described relative types
type Boundary = 'clippingParents' | HTMLElement;
type RootBoundary = 'document' | 'viewport';
type Padding =
  | {|
      top?: number,
      left?: number,
      right?: number,
      bottom?: number,
    |}
  | number;
```

### `fallbackPlacements`

If the popper has placement set to `bottom`, but there isn't enough space to
position the popper in that direction, by default, it will change the popper
placement to `top`. As soon as enough space is detected, the placement will be
reverted to the originally defined (or preferred) one.

You can also define fallback placements by providing a list of placements to
try. When no space is available on the preferred placement, the modifier will
test the ones provided in the list, and use the first useful one.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  placement: 'left',
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      options: {
        fallbackPlacements: ['top', 'right'],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

In the above example, the popper will be placed on left if there's enough space,
if not, it will try the top placement, and if the top placement doesn't fit
either, it will try to use the right placement. If even the right placement
doesn't fit, it reverts back to the original placement.

### `padding`

If you don't want the popper to reach the _very_ edge of the boundary area, you
can apply some padding. This will make the popper flip earlier (in pixels) than
the true edge.

You can pass a `number`, which will be equal padding on all four sides, or an
`object` containing side properties each with their own padding value.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      options: {
        // Equal padding on all four sides
        padding: 8,
        // Different padding on certain sides. Unspecified sides are 0.
        padding: { top: 58, bottom: 8, right: 15 },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `boundary`

This describes the area that the popper will be constrained within (not allowed
to overflow). Once the popper reaches the edge of this area, it will attempt to
flip to another side.

By default, it is `"clippingParents"`, which are the scrolling containers that
may cause the popper to be partially or fully cut off.

```js
const element = document.querySelector('#parentElement');

createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      options: {
        area: element,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `rootBoundary`

This describes the root boundary that will be checked for overflow. There are
only two "roots" â€“ the viewport and the document. `"viewport"` is default, which
is the area of the document the user can actually see on the screen.
`"document"` is the entire page which can be potentially scrolled.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        rootBoundary: 'document', // 'viewport' by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `flipVariations`

When using variation placements (e.g. `top-start`), the popper will attempt to
flip the opposite variation if the preferred variation does not fit. This allows
the popper to stay aligned to the edge of the reference element before
`preventOverflow` has a chance to misalign it.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      options: {
        flipVariations: false, // true by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Data

```flow
type Data = {
  // The current index in the placement order it's trying.
  index: number,
  // The preferred fallback variation placement to use if no placements fit.
  fallbackVariation: Placement,
};
```
