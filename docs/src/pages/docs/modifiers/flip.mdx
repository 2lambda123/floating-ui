# Flip

The flip modifier can change the `placement` of a popper when the
`detectOverflow` modifier reported is overflowing on the direction of the
currently given placement.

> **Note**: to customize the behavior of the `flip`'s `detectOverflow` modifier,
> you will need to specify as modifier name `detectOverflow:flip`. This is a
> modifier instance dedicated to the `flip` modifier.

## Options

```flow
type Options = {
  fallbackPlacements: Array<Placement>, // [oppositePlacement]
  padding: Padding, // 0
};

/**
 * Below are described the relative types
 */
type Padding =
  | {|
      top?: number,
      left?: number,
      right?: number,
      bottom?: number,
    |}
  | number;
```

### Options#fallbackPlacements

If the popper has placement set to `bottom`, but there isn't space to position
the popper in that direction, by default, it will change the popper placement to
`top`. As soon enough space is detected, the placement will be reverted to the
originally defined one.

You can also define custom "flip" fallback placements, by providing a list of
placements to try. Doing so, when no space is available on the defined
placement, the modifier will test the ones provided in the list, and use the
first useful one.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  placement: 'left',
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      options: {
        fallbackPlacements: ['top', 'right'],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

In the above example, the popper will be placed on left if there's enough space,
if not, it will try the top placement, and if even on the top placement there's
not enough space, it will try to use the right placement. Note that if none of
the placements is suitable, the original left placement will be used.

### Options#padding

You can apply some additional padding to the boundaries defined by the
`detectOverflow` modifier by setting this option to a number, to apply the
padding evenly to all the four sides, or to an object containing the `top`,
`left`, `bottom`, `right` properties, with a padding number for each side.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      options: {
        padding: { top: 20, right: 10 },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Customize `detectOverflow:flip`

If you'd like to change the boundary area of the `flip` modifier, you can
customize the `detectOverflow:flip` modifier:

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'detectOverflow:flip',
      options: {
        rootArea: 'document', // `viewport` by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
