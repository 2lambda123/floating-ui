title: Detect Overflow

# Detect Overflow

The detectOverflow modifier can signal other modifiers when a popper element is
scheduled to be positioned outside a given boundary, or container element.

## Options

```js
type Options = {
  boundaryElement: HTMLElement, // popper's clipping parent
};
```

### Options#boundaryElement

By default, the boundary element is set to the closest scrolling clipping
container, which, in other words, is a container with scrollbars, that can
potentially hide the popper if the latter is positioned outside of the visible
container area.

If none of these containers is found, it will fallback to the page viewport,
which is the visible document area.

We can define an arbitrary boundary element, we just need to make sure the
custom element is a parent of the popper element.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'detectOverflow',
      options: {
        boundaryElement: document.querySelector('#custom'),
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
