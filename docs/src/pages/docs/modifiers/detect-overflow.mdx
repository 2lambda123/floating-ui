# Detect Overflow

The detectOverflow modifier can signal other modifiers when a popper element is
scheduled to be positioned outside a given boundary, or container element.

## Options

```flow
type Options = {
  area: OverflowArea,
  rootArea: RootOverflowArea,
  elementContext: Context,
  altArea: boolean,
};
```

### Options#area

By default, the boundary is set to a virtual area to make so the popper element
will never get clipped by a scrolling parent with clipping capabilities.

This is what you need most of the times, and it's called `clippingParents`, but
if you'd like to customize it further, this option can be set to `viewport`, or
to an arbitrary parent element.

If the provided area is not found for whatever reason, the modifier will
fallback to the `rootArea` option, which can be either `viewport` or `document`.

We can define an arbitrary boundary element, we just need to make sure the
custom element is a parent of the popper element.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'detectOverflow',
      options: {
        area: document.querySelector('#custom'),
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
