# Documentation

Popper is distributed in 3 different versions, in 3 different file formats.

The 3 file formats are:

- `esm` (works with `import` syntax â€” **recommended**)
- `umd` (works with `<script>` tags or RequireJS)
- `cjs` (works with `require()` syntax)

The 3 versions are:

- `popper`: includes all the modifiers (features) in one file (**default for
  `umd`**);
- `popper-lite`: includes only the minimum amount of modifiers to provide the
  basic functionality;
- `popper-base`: doesn't include any modifier, you must import them separately
  (**default for `esm` and `cjs`**);

## Basic Usage

For most of the use cases, you will want to import the library complete of all
its functionalities, to do that you can follow the example below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Popper example</title>

<style>
  #tooltip {
    background-color: rebeccapurple;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 200px;
  }
</style>

<button type="button" id="button">I'm a button</button>
<div id="tooltip">I'm a tooltip</div>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@popperjs/core"></script>
<script>
  Popper.createPopper(
    document.querySelector('#button'),
    document.querySelector('#tooltip'),
    {
      placement: 'right',
    }
  );
</script>
```

## Composition

The library is built in a modular way to allow to import only the parts you
really need.

### Importing just what you need

The core can be imported as follows:

```js
import { createPopper } from '@popperjs/core/lib/popper-base.js';
```

This, by default, will not produce any of the results you would expect from
Popper, since it lacks all the modifiers needed to enable the library to do it.

If you'd like to compose a super minimal Popper, you could do the follow:

```js
import { popperGenerator } from '@popperjs/core/lib/popper-base.js';
import popperOffsets from '@popperjs/core/lib/modifiers/popperOffsets.js';
import computeStyles from '@popperjs/core/lib/modifiers/computeStyles.js';
import applyStyles from '@popperjs/core/lib/modifiers/applyStyles.js';

const createPopper = popperGenerator({
  defaultModifiers: [popperOffsets, computeStyles, applyStyles],
});

// use `createPopper` to power your tooltips
```

### Meet Popper Lite

If you need some basic positioning logic, but don't want to configure it by
yourself, you can use `popper-lite`.

This version of the library includes only the minimum amount of code to position
your tooltips, and have them react to scroll and window resize. But it doesn't
include any of the more advanced features such as overflow detection.

```js
import { createPopper } from '@popperjs/core/lib/popper-lite.js';

// use `createPopper` to power your tooltips
```
