title: Detect Overflow

# Detect Overflow

The `detectOverflow` utility returns an object of overflow offsets of the popper
or reference element relative to a given boundary.

```js
import detectOverflow from '@popperjs/core/lib/utils/detectOverflow';

const overflow = detectOverflow(state, options);
```

You can use this utility within your own custom modifiers.

## State

The first argument is the popper instance state that gets passed in to
modifiers.

## Options

```flow
type Options = {
  placement: Placement, // state.placement
  boundary: Boundary, // "clippingParents"
  rootBoundary: RootBoundary, // "document"
  elementContext: Context, // "popper"
  altBoundary: boolean, // false
};

// Below are the relative types
// See `preventOverflow` or `flip` for the others
type Context = 'reference' | 'popper';
```

### `placement`

This will check the overflow when the popper is given this placement, even if
it's not the current `state.placement`.

### `boundary`

The same `Boundary` type that `preventOverflow` and `flip` accept.

### `rootBoundary`

The same `RootBoundary` type that `preventOverflow` and `flip` accept.

### `elementContext`

This describes the element that is being checked for overflow relative to the
boundary.

### `altBoundary`

This describes whether to use the alt element's boundary. For example, if the
`elementContext` is `"popper"`, then it will check the reference's boundary
context, and vice-versa.

## Return value

```flow
// If the number is positive, the popper is overflowing by that number of pixels.
// When 0, or negative, the popper is within its boundaries.
type OverflowOffsets = {
  top: number,
  bottom: number,
  right: number,
  left: number,
};
```
