# Browser Support

Popper (v2) supports Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, additionally, any
Chromium-based browser, such as Microsoft Edge (2020), Opera, etc should be
supported.

<x-ad />

Microsoft Edge (2019 and earlier) is supported as well, but you may need to
provide some polyfills to make sure Popper has access to all the browser APIs it
requires. The same is valid for Internet Explorer 11.

We reccomend to use the following snippet to automatically include the required
polyfills in your web page:

```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=Array.prototype.find,Array.prototype.includes,Array.from,Object.entries,Promise,Object.assign"></script>
```

Right now, Internet Explorer 10 and older versions aren't tested but may work,
please report back if you successfully run Popper in those browsers.
