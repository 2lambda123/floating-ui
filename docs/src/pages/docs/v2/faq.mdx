# FAQ

Note: this page is a work in progress right now. Popper 2 is newly released so
we don't have many questions yet.

## Why is my popper overflowing or slightly off center?

Ensure you don't have CSS `margin` applied to the popper.

To replicate margin, use the `offset` modifier to apply some distance between
the popper and its reference element, as well as the `padding` option in
`preventOverflow` or `flip` to apply some padding between the popper's boundary.

## Why is my popper jittering while scrolling?

Try using the `"fixed"` strategy.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  strategy: 'fixed',
});
```
