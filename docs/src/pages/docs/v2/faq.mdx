# FAQ

Note: this page is a work in progress right now. Popper 2 is newly released so
we don't have many questions yet.

## Why is my popper jittering while scrolling?

Try using the `"fixed"` strategy.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  strategy: 'fixed',
});
```

## Are there any breaking changes between v1 and v2?

Yes! We'll try to list them all below:

1. `new Popper(...)` has been replaced by `createPopper(...)`;
2. `options.modifiers` is now an array, containing modifiers identified by a
   `name` property;
3. Dedicated modifier's options are now grouped inside the `options` property;
4. `innerModifier` is gone, you can use the `offset` modifier to replace it;
5. `keepTogether` modifier is gone, take a look at the `preventOverflow`
   modifier options instead;
6. Using `margin` CSS properties to offset your poppers is not supported
   anymore, use the `offset` modifier instead;
7. `options.positionFixed` has been replaced by `options.strategy`, which can be
   set to `'fixed'`;
8. The `x-placement`, `x-arrow`, and all the other HTML attributes have been
   replaced by `data-popper-*` prefixed attributes;
9. `instance.scheduleUpdate()` is now `instance.update()`, and it now returns a
   promise;
10. `instance.update()` is now `instance.forceUpdate()`;
11. If the `flip` modifier has not enough space to flip your popper, the
    original placement will be used;
