# 3rd Party

Popper can't ship every possible modifier by default due to bundle size and
complexity constraints, but its architecture is built with extensibility in mind
to enable **custom modifiers** written by you or the community to suit any
possible use case without Popper needing to support it by default.

<x-ad />

Here are some common examples:

- [`maxSize` modifier](https://codesandbox.io/s/great-tesla-3roz7?file=/src/index.js):
  changes the size of your popper to fit it within the available viewport space.
  (published as an npm package)
- [`sameWidth` modifier](https://codesandbox.io/s/bitter-sky-pe3z9?file=/src/index.js):
  make your popper the same width as the reference.

We encourage you to publish your own popper modifiers as npm packages to be
downloaded by the community if you think they're useful or complex enough!
