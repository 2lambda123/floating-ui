# flip

`flip(){:js}` changes the placement of the floating element to
the opposite one by default in order to keep it in view.

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <Chrome
    label="Scroll the container"
    center
    scrollable
    className="h-96"
  >
    <Floating middleware={[{name: 'flip'}]}>
      <div className="grid place-items-center w-32 h-32 border-2 border-gray-1000 border-dashed" />
    </Floating>
  </Chrome>
</div>

It also has the ability to flip to _any_ placement, not just the
opposite one.

## Usage

```js
import {computePosition, flip} from '@floating-ui/dom';

computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  middleware: [flip()],
});
```

> This cannot be used alongside `autoPlacement(){:js}`. See
> [Conflict with autoPlacement](/docs/flip#conflict-with-autoplacement).

## Options

These are the options you can pass to `flip(){:js}`.

```ts
interface Options extends DetectOverflowOptions {
  mainAxis?: boolean;
  crossAxis?: boolean;
  fallbackPlacements?: Array<Placement>;
  fallbackStrategy?: 'bestFit' | 'initialPlacement';
  flipAlignment?: boolean;
}
```

### mainAxis

default: `true{:js}`

This is the main axis in which overflow is checked to perform a
flip.

- `y`-axis for `'top'{:js}` and `'bottom'{:js}` placements
- `x`-axis for `'left'{:js}` and `'right'{:js}` placements

```js
flip({mainAxis: false});
```

### crossAxis

default: `true{:js}`

This is the cross axis in which overflow is checked to perform a
flip, the opposite axis of `mainAxis{:.objectKey}`.

```js
flip({crossAxis: false});
```

### fallbackPlacements

default: `[oppositePlacement]{:js}`

This describes the array of placements to try if the preferred
`placement{:.objectKey}` doesn't fully fit on the axes in which
overflow is checked (both by default).

```js
flip({
  fallbackPlacements: ['right', 'bottom'],
});
```

If the `placement{:.objectKey}` in `computePosition(){:js}` is
set to `'top'{:js}`, but that doesn't fit, then `'right'{:js}`
will be used instead. If `'right'{:js}` also doesn't fit, then
`'bottom'{:js}` will be used. If none of these fit, then the
best-fitting placement will be used.

### fallbackStrategy

default: `'bestFit'{:js}`

When no placements fit, then you'll want to decide what happens.
`'bestFit'{:js}` will use the placement which fits best on the
checked axes. `'initialPlacement'{:js}` will use the initial
`placement{:.objectKey}` specified.

```js
flip({
  fallbackStrategy: 'initialPlacement',
});
```

### flipAlignment

default: `true{:js}`

When an alignment is specified, e.g. `'top-start'{:js}` instead
of just `'top'{:js}`, this will flip to `'top-end'{:js}` if
`start{:.string}` doesn't fit.

```js
flip({flipAlignment: false});
```

When using this with the `shift(){:js}` middleware, ensure
`flip(){:js}` is placed **before** `shift(){:js}` in your
middleware array. This ensures the `flipAlignment{:.objectKey}`
logic can act before shift's does.

### ...detectOverflowOptions

All of [detectOverflow](/docs/detectOverflow#options)'s options
can be passed. For instance:

```js
flip({padding: 5}); // 0 by default
```

## Final placement

The placement returned from the function is always the final one,
not necessarily the one you passed in as the "preferred" one.

```js
computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  placement: 'bottom',
  middleware: [flip()],
}).then(({placement}) => {
  console.log(placement); // 'top' or 'bottom'
});
```

## Conflict with autoPlacement

`flip(){:js}` and `autoPlacement(){:js}` cannot be used together
inside the same middleware array, make sure you choose only one
of them to use.

The reason is they both try to perform work on the placement but
with opposing strategies. Therefore, they will continually try to
change the result or work of other one, leading to a reset loop.

- `flip(){:js}` — Uses a fallback "no space" strategy. Ensures
  the user's preferred placement is kept unless there is no space
  left.
- `autoPlacement(){:js}` — Uses a primary "most space" strategy.
  Always chooses the placement with the most space available.
