# computePosition

The `computePosition(){:js}` function returns the `x` and `y`
coordinates to place a floating element next to a given reference
element.

Together with [autoUpdate](/docs/autoUpdate), the floating
element remains “anchored” to the reference element.

## Usage

Floating UI works with two elements:

- **Reference element** — also known as the anchor element, this
  is the element that is being _referred_ to for positioning.
  Often this is a button that triggers a popup like a tooltip or
  menu.
- **Floating element** — this is the element that floats next to
  the reference element, remaining anchored to it. This is the
  popup or tooltip itself.

```html
<button id="button">My reference element</button>
<div id="tooltip">My floating element</div>
```

First, give the floating element initial CSS styles so that its
layout is ready for being measured:

```css
#tooltip {
  width: max-content;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

> These styles are explained below in
> [Initial layout](/docs/computePosition#initial-layout).

Then, ensuring that these two elements are rendered onto the
document and can be measured, call `computePosition(){:js}` with
them as arguments.

The first argument is the reference to anchor to, and the second
is the floating element to be positioned.

```js /button/ /tooltip/
import {computePosition} from '@floating-ui/dom';

const button = document.querySelector('#button');
const tooltip = document.querySelector('#tooltip');

computePosition(button, tooltip).then(({x, y}) => {
  Object.assign(tooltip.style, {
    left: `${x}px`,
    top: `${y}px`,
  });
});
```

`computePosition(){:js}` returns a `Promise{:.class}` that
resolves with the coordinates that can be used to apply styles to
the floating element.

By default, the floating element will be placed at the bottom
center of the reference element.

### Initial layout

To ensure positioning works smoothly, the dimensions of the
floating element should not change before and after being
positioned.

The CSS styles applied before `computePosition(){:js}` is called
therefore have significance:

- `position: absolute{:sass}`

This lets the element float on top of the UI with intrinsic
dimensions based on the content, instead of acting as a block.

- `width: max-content{:sass}` (or a fixed value)
- `top: 0{:sass}`
- `left: 0{:sass}`

These properties prevent the floating element from resizing when
it overflows a container, removing layout interference that can
cause incorrect measurements.

## Options

Passed as a third argument, this is the object to configure the
behavior.

```js
computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  // options
});
```

### placement

Where to place the floating element relative to its reference
element. 12 strings are available:

```ts
type Placement =
  | 'top'
  | 'top-start'
  | 'top-end'
  | 'right'
  | 'right-start'
  | 'right-end'
  | 'bottom'
  | 'bottom-start'
  | 'bottom-end'
  | 'left'
  | 'left-start'
  | 'left-end';
```

```js
computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  placement: 'bottom-start', // 'bottom' by default
});
```

The `-start{:.string}` and `-end{:.string}` alignments are
[_logical_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties)
and will adapt to the writing direction (e.g. RTL) as expected.

### strategy

This is the type of CSS position property to use. Two strings are
available:

```ts
type Strategy = 'absolute' | 'fixed';
```

```js
computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  strategy: 'fixed', // 'absolute' by default
});
```

Apply `position: fixed{:sass}` to your floating element (instead
of `position: absolute{:sass}`) prior to the
`computePosition(){:js}` call.

The `'fixed'{:js}` strategy is useful in two ways:

- Reduces "jumpiness" caused by needing to reposition the
  floating element continually while scrolling if the reference
  element is fixed.
- Breaks the floating element out of a clipping container (make
  it top-layer on the UI) more frequently than `'absolute'{:js}`
  will.

### middleware

`computePosition(){:js}` starts with a basic placement anchor
position. To modify this, middleware are used.

These functions alter the positioning coordinates from the basic
placement to customize the position, provide data, or act as
techniques to optimize the visibility of the floating element.

The following are included in the package:

- `offset(){:js}`
- `shift(){:js}`
- `flip(){:js}`
- `arrow(){:js}`
- `size(){:js}`
- `autoPlacement(){:js}`
- `hide(){:js}`
- `inline(){:js}`

These are documented in the navigation bar on the left.
Importantly, you can also craft your own custom middleware to
extend the behavior of the library.

## Return value

```ts
interface ComputePositionReturn {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  // The stateful placement, which can be different
  // from the initial `placement` passed as options
  placement: Placement;
  strategy: Strategy;
  middlewareData: MiddlewareData;
}
```

## Updating

Since `computePosition(){:js}` is only a single function call, it
only positions your element once. To ensure the floating element
remains anchored to the reference element in a variety of
scenarios, use the [autoUpdate](/docs/autoUpdate) utility.
